## Challenge Prompt
Select one of the following:
1) Build and test a quantum random number generator using Hadamard gates.
2) Simulate a quantum double-slit experiment using quantum circuits.
3) Create all four Bell states using basic quantum gates, and verify them with measurement statistics.
4) Design a quantum dice (6-sided) using multiple qubits and validate fairness using Bornâ€™s rule.
5) Modify the modular exponentiation circuit to factor a different semi-prime.
