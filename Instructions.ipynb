    "\n",
    "The goal of this hackathon challenge is to create an educational, beginner-friendly tutorial that guides participants through implementing a famous quantum experiment on real IBM quantum hardware using Qiskit. The challenge is designed to be approachable for high school and undergraduate students, emphasizing both conceptual understanding and practical skills."

    "## Challenge Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teach a foundational quantum experiment** (e.g., Bell State, Shor’s Algorithm with 5–7 qubits, Double-slit, etc.)\n",
    "- **Guide students step by step** from theory to implementation, building intuition about why each part of the algorithm works.\n",
    "- **Run at least one exercise on real IBM Qiskit hardware** (using free backends, with short runtime).\n",
    "- **Make results easy to understand and visualize** for beginners.\n",
    "- **Avoid significant overlap** with other hackathon challenges.\n",
    "- **Ensure clarity, accessibility, and educational value** throughout the notebook."

    "## Challenge Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Step-by-Step Tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break down the chosen experiment into intuitive steps.\n",
    "- Connect mathematical concepts to quantum circuit construction.\n",
    "- Anticipate and address common points of confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Qiskit Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All code must run on:\n",
    "  - Local Qiskit installations (Windows/Mac)\n",
    "  - qBraid Lab (`lab.qbraid.com`)\n",
    "- At least one exercise must run on real IBM Qiskit hardware.\n",
    "- Include code for:\n",
    "  - Submitting jobs and saving Job IDs\n",
    "  - Retrieving and visualizing results\n",
    "  - Estimating runtime (preferably <5 minutes per job)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Testing and Grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a separate `.py` script for local correctness checks before hardware submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use plots, circuit diagrams, and other visual tools to clarify results and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Exercises**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include 1–3 smaller exercises that build toward the final hardware experiment.\n",
    "- Final exercise should be tuneable (e.g., number of qubits, measurement basis).\n",
    "- At least one exercise should require thoughtful reasoning, not just code completion."

    "- Add any additional files (e.g., testing scripts) to the same repository.\n",
    "- Ensure the notebook renders correctly on GitHub and is easy to follow.\n",
    "- Provide a README with brief instructions for running the notebook locally.\n",
    "- Submit your GitHub repo link via the official submission form."
